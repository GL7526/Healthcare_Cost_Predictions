# Healthcare_Cost_Predictions
This repository is dedicated to a project between myself and George which attempts to predict the annual cost of healthcare for people who have employee-sponsored insurance between 2013 and 2017 depending on their class of treatment (inpatient, outpatient, etc.). We applied multiple linear regression models to capture the data and chose the optimal one to capture our data. 


The data are totals for specific treatments between 2013 and 2017 as given by the Heath Care Cost Institute. The data can be found under "Public Data" and in the link "Annual Report Dataset" in the following webpage: https://healthcostinstitute.org/data
